# Paima Crypto

A library to handle the cryptography of all blockchains supported by Paima

You can find the full docs for Paima [here](https://docs.paimastudios.com/). \
**Note**: We generally recommend using [@paima/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paima/sdk) instead of this SDK to get all Paima features as a single package.
