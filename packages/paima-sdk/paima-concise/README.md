# Paima Concise Encoding Library library

An encoding library that all games can use to build and consume concisely encoded game inputs. This library acts as one level of abstraction up from the game input strings, and supports abstractions such as the state identifier.

You can find the full docs for Paima [here](https://docs.paimastudios.com/). \
**Note**: We generally recommend using [@paima/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paima/sdk) instead of this SDK to get all Paima features as a single package.
